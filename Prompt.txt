Act as a Power BI expert and senior data engineer.

Create a realistic **Pharmacy Sales dataset** suitable for Power BI, Tableau, and portfolio projects, strictly adhering to the specifications below.

Dataset requirements:

* Generate a sufficiently large dataset (minimum 1,000+ rows; higher volume preferred for analytical richness).
* Output should be suitable for Excel / BI tools.

Columns and constraints:

1. **Brand**

   * Include **6–8 popular Indian pharmaceutical brands** (e.g., leading domestic and multinational pharma companies operating in India).

2. **Discount_Band**

   * Categorical column with exactly four values:

     * High
     * Medium
     * Low
     * None

3. **Category**

   * Include the following dosage-form categories only:

     * Orals
     * Parenteral
     * Topical
     * Inhalation
     * Rectal
     * Vaginal
     * Nasal
     * Otic
     * Transdermal

4. **Sub_Category**

   * Must logically map to Category as follows:

     * Orals → Tablet, Syrup
     * Parenteral → Intravenous (IV), Subcutaneous (SC)
     * Topical → Cream, Gel
     * Inhalation → Nebulizer, Dry Powder Inhaler (DPI)
     * Rectal → Suppository, Enema
     * Vaginal → Vaginal Cream, Vaginal Tablet
     * Nasal → Nasal Spray, Nasal Gel
     * Otic → Ear Drops, Otic Suspension
     * Transdermal → Reservoir Patch

5. **City**

   * Include exactly **8 Indian cities**.

6. **Region**

   * Include exactly **4 regions**:

     * East
     * West
     * North
     * South
   * City and Region must be **geographically correlated correctly for India**.

7. **Numeric Columns**

   * Sales
   * Gross_Sales
   * Units_Sold
   * Manufacturing_Cost
   * Profit
   * Ensure all numeric values are realistic and internally consistent.

8. **Date Columns**

   * Date (full transaction date)
   * Month_Name (derived from Date)

Business logic requirements:

* Gross_Sales should be logically derived from Units_Sold and pricing assumptions.
* Sales should reflect post-discount values based on Discount_Band.
* Profit should be derived after accounting for Manufacturing_Cost.
* Discount_Band should meaningfully influence Sales and Profit.
* Category, Sub_Category, Brand, City, and Region relationships must be logically consistent and realistic.

Output expectations:

* Dataset must be clean, well-structured, analytics-ready, and suitable for Power BI dashboarding.
* Data should reflect realistic pharmacy sales behavior in the Indian market.
* The dataset should be appropriate for portfolio presentation and interview demonstrations.
