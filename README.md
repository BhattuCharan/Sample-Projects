🏥 Pharmacy Sales Analytics Dashboard (India)
📌 Project Overview

This project showcases an end-to-end analytics workflow using a synthetic pharmacy sales dataset representing transaction-level sales in the Indian healthcare market.

The objective is to demonstrate data engineering, data cleaning, Power BI modeling, and dashboard design skills through a single, well-structured portfolio project.

The final output is an interactive one-page Power BI dashboard suitable for executive reporting, business analysis, and interview demonstrations.

The dataset simulates realistic pharmacy sales behavior across:

Indian pharmaceutical brands

Dosage categories and sub-categories

Discount strategies

Cities and regions in India

Time (monthly and yearly trends)

It contains 2,000 records with financial, product, geographic, and time attributes, enabling comprehensive analysis of:

Sales performance

Profitability

Regional and city-level trends

🔹 Note

This dataset is synthetic and created purely for educational and portfolio purposes.
The prompt used to generate this dataset has been uploaded to the repository to ensure transparency and reproducibility.

🏗️ Dataset Creation Process

The dataset was programmatically generated with the following considerations:

6–8 popular Indian pharmaceutical brands

Dosage-based product categories:

Orals, Parenteral, Topical, Inhalation, Rectal, Vaginal, Nasal, Otic, Transdermal

Logical Category → Sub-Category mapping

Discount bands:

High, Medium, Low, None

8 Indian cities, mapped correctly to 4 regions:

North, South, East, West

Realistic sales, cost, and profit calculations

Transaction dates spanning 2022–2024

Business Logic Applied

Gross Sales derived from units sold and pricing assumptions

Discounts applied based on Discount Band

Profit calculated after deducting Manufacturing Cost

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation (Power BI)

The following steps were performed in Power BI:

Verified correct data types for numeric, text, and date columns

Created a clean Date column (2022–2024) using DAX for reliable time analysis

Derived Month Name from Date and applied correct month sorting

Created measures instead of calculated columns for dynamic analysis

Validated logical relationships between Category, Sub-Category, City, and Region

Ensured no negative or illogical financial values

🧠 Data Modeling & DAX Measures

Key measures created using DAX:

Total Sales

Total Profit

Gross Sales

Units Sold

Profit Margin % (Profit / Sales)

Time-based aggregations for monthly and yearly trends

All measures respond dynamically to slicers and filters, following Power BI best practices.

📈 Dashboard Design & Visual Selection

A single-page Power BI dashboard was designed to present all key insights without scrolling.
